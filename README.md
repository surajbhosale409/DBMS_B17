Hello everyone,

		I have provided student.sql file, it contains the tables and triggers that were 
	covered by me in the class. Following is the DATABASE SCHEMA from student.sql
	
	TABLES:
		[1] student 	(attributes:  rollNo,firstName,lastName,emailId)
		[2] log    	(attributes:  rollNo,entryDate)
		[3] validRollNo	(attributes:  rollNo)
	
	Read this student.sql file in your sqlite3 database for reference.

	For practice you I have provided a third trigger problem that you should write if you want.
	Problem is given in the same file student.sql

Thanks and Regards,

Suraj Rajendra Bhosale.
